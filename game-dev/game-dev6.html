        Game Jams are competitions where indie game developers in small teams or alone make a game in a set ammount of time and get judged. 
        Game Jams test your will against pressure and stress from the short time frame and testing all your skills to make the best game possible, not letting you waste any time.
        They usually vary from 24 hours to several months and are hosted mostly on itch.io, a game publishing website. They are a way to meet new people and work together to reach a goal.

        Some of the most populated and famous game jams are the Anuel GMTK game jams hosted by the Game Maker Toolkit youtube channel. In the game jam you have to make a game in 48 hours then get juged by many judges.
        The 2021 GMTK game jam was the largest game jam on the website attracting tens of thousands. The 2022 one is coming up in a month. This isn't the only game jam though.
        There are tons of game jams out there that you can join for fun, competition, or to improve your skills.
