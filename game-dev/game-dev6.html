      Game Jams are competitions where indie game developers, in either small teams or alone, make a game in a set amount of time and get judged. 
      Game Jams test your will against pressure and stress from the short time frame and test all your skills to make the best game possible, not letting you waste any time.
      They usually vary from 24 hours to several months and are mainly hosted on itch.io, a game publishing website. They are a way to meet new people and work together to reach a goal.

      Some of the most populated and famous game jams are the Anuel GMTK game jams hosted by the Game Maker Toolkit youtube channel. In the game jam, you make a game in 48 hours and then get judged by many judges.
      The 2021 GMTK game jam was the most populated game jam on the website, attracting tens of thousands of people. The 2022 one is coming up in a month. These aren't the only game jam, though.
      There are tons of game jams out there that you can join for fun, competition, or to improve your skills.
