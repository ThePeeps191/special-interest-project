      I started game dev about three years ago, shortly after learning the language of computers. In this time, I've learned so much, but I can still learn so much more, which is why I chose this for my topic.
      I hope that after seeing this presentation, you'll consider trying it out.
      There are no downsides to trying new things, and it might become a new hobby.
      I hope you enjoyed my presentation, and thank you for listening!
