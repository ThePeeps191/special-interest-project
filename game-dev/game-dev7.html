        I've published two games in my "career" with game dev. The first one is a 2d infinite platformer game.
        You're in a 2d world with a moving platform that slowly moves faster.
        You can infinitely play it until you fall off a platform and land in the lava.
        Your objective is to collect as many points as possible before you die.
        I made this game for a game jam that I got 2nd in. For that, I got a $10 amazon gift card 2 years ago.

        My second game is one I'm currently working on. It's a 3d fps where you in a 3d map and shoot people in the first person.
        The objective is to kill all the drones and turrets with different guns. You win if you successfully kill all the enemies without dying.
        I'm working on this for fun and am planning to publish it.
