        I've made 2 published games in my "career" with game dev. The first one is a 2d infinite platformer game.
        You're in a 2d world wit moving platform that slowly move faster.
        You can infinitly play it until you fall off a platform and land in the lava.
        Your objective is to collect as many points as possible before you die.
        I made this game for a game jam that I got 2nd in. For that, I got a $10 amazon gift card 2 years ago.

        My second game is one I'm currectly working on. Its a 3d fps where your in a 3d map and shoot people in first person.
        The objective is to kill all the drones and turrents with a sorts of guns. You win if you sucessfully kill all the enemies without dying.
        I'm working on this for fun and am planning to publish it.
