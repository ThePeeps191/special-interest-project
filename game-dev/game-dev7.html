        I've published two games in my "career" with game dev. The first one is a 2D infinite platformer game.
        You're in a 2D world with a moving platform that slowly moves faster.
        You can play it infinitely until you fall off a platform and land in the lava.
        Your objective is to collect as many points as possible before you die.
        I made this game for a game jam that I got second and got a $10 Amazon gift card.

        My second game is one I'm currently working on. It's a 3D fps where you are in a 3D map and shoot people in a first-person perspective.
        The objective is to kill all the drones and turrets with different guns. You win if you successfully kill all the enemies without dying.
        I am working on this for fun and am planning to publish it.
