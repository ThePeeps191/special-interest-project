        Once you learn all the skills and familerize yourself with your game engine you can start making full fleged games. The worst feeling is spending time on a game then after finishing, noticing that its not fun.
        Things like that destroys you after all the time you spent. Everything in your mind thinks its a good idea until you actually make it, and whats the point of games if they're not fun.
        To minimize the risk of this, you can present your ideas to others and ask for their opinun. You can also make a small copy of the game to test it.
        Once you somewhat formulate an idea and have explained it to you others you can start making your game.
        The process is simple enough, having some sort of idea and making all the fetures, the behaviour, the componments, and polishing.
        You'll have to use all the skills you learned along to way to make a finished, complete, polished game to publish. One extra thing is the use of ads.
        Personally, I've never used any but if you get companies to agree to put ads on your game, you can earn some money yourself. Or you can just make the game paid but for your complete game, I wouldn't recomend it.
        After publishing your first game, you can go whatever direction you want, do whatever you want, and make whatever you want. Good Luck on your journey with Game Dev.
