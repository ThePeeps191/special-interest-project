      Once you learn all the skills and familiarize yourself with your game engine, you can start making full-fledged games. The worst feeling is spending time on a game and then, after finishing, noticing that it's not fun.
      Things like this put you down after all the time spent. Everything in your mind tells you it's a good idea until you make it, and what's the point of games if they're not fun.
      To minimize the risk, you can present your ideas to others and ask for their opinion. You can also make a small copy of the game to test it.
      Once you have formulated an idea and explained it to others, you can start making your game.

      The process is simple enough, making all the features, the behaviour, the components, the visuals, and polishing. It'll take time, but if you have a direction in mind, you can do it.
      You'll have to use all the skills you learned to make a finished, complete, polished game to publish. One extra thing is the use of ads.
      I've never used any, but if you get companies to agree to put ads on your game, you can earn some money yourself. Another option is making a paid game. This isn't recomended because its your first game, and you don't know if people will enjoy it.
      After publishing your first game, you can continue in whatever direction you want, do whatever you want, and make whatever you want.
      Good luck on your journey with game development!
