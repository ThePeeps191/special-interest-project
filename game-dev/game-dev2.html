        There are many routes to game dev and none of them are really correct but I'll be telling you about my method.

        1. The first step is to choose a game engine. A game engine is a software that does most of the repetitive things for you like making a screen and view, rendering in sprites, and scripting bahavior.
        You don't techniclly need a game engine but it helps a lot with starting game dev.
        Each game engine has there own unique fetures and approch, with each one suiting a different person depending on their work style, experience, and envirment.
        Some notible game engines include Unity, Unreal, GameMaker Studio 1-2 and many others.

        2. This step is the most important step. Once you get onto a game engine, you'll have to familerize yourself with the mechanics and the most basic skills.
        Repeat this process many times till you remember the basic skills completly. Practice your skills by making small snipits of games and familerize yourself with the game engine.
        If you ever in the future forget any of these skills, you can't progress much so focus on these things.
