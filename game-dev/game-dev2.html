        There are many routes to game dev and none of them are really correct but I'll be telling you about my method.

      1. The first step is to choose a game engine. A game engine is a software that does most of the repetitive things for you, like making a screen and view, rendering in sprites, and scripting behaviour.
      You don't technically need a game engine, but it helps a lot with starting game dev.
      Each game engine has there own unique features and approach, with each one suiting a different person depending on their work style, experience, and environment.
      Some notable game engines include Unity, Unreal, GameMaker Studio 1-2, and many others.

      2. This step is the most important. Once you get onto a game engine, you'll have to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and the most basic skills.
      Repeat this process many times till you remember the basic skills completely. Practice your skills by making small snippets of games and familiarize yourself with the game engine.
      If you forget any of these skills in the future, you can't progress much, so focus on these things.
