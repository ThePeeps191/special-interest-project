    <h1><strong><header>What is Game Development?</header></strong></h1>
    <p><nav>
        Game development shortened to game dev is pretty self-explanatory. It's the process of making games for people to play and enjoy. When you start coding, you can move in many different directions.
        Game dev is one of those many directions you can pursue, including web dev, AI, competitive or machine learning. It's split into two sections, indie games and not indie games.
        Indie games, games made by less than 30 people, are what we'll be focusing on in this presentation.

        There are many reasons why you should start and pursue game dev.
        Many people want something new that they can continue for a long time.
        Game dev is an enormous community of people dedicated to their work. Making games is a way to connect with people that share your interest. Game dev is a steadily increasing industry, so many people can help you get started.
        You feel proud when you take the time to make a game, see many people enjoying it, and feel that you've actually accomplished something in your life. 
        And if you add a bit of advertisement or something you can buy, you might even get a bit of money out of it.
