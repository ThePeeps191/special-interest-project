    <h1>What is Game Development</h1>
    <p><nav>
        Game dev is pretty self explanatory. Its the process of making games for people to play and enjoy.
        Game dev is one of the many directions that you can persue when you code, like web dev, AI or machine learning.
        There are many reasons why you should start and pursue game dev. I know you probably don't want to listen to all this so I'll make my presentation reasonably quick.
        Making games are a way of connecting to others, meeting many people that share you interest and adding to the community.
        You feel proud when you take time to make a game and then see many people enjoy it after publication.
        And if you add a bit of ads or something you can buy, you might even get a bit of money out of it.
